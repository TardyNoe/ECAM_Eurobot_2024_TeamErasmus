## Project Overview
Welcome to the main repository of our Eurobot Robotics Project.

## Components

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Robotic System:** This includes the design and code for the robot itself, featuring an Arduino Uno, ESP32, sensors, and motor controllers.
2. **External Positioning System:** A separate system for the external positioning systemand and it's communication with the robot.


## Repositories

- [**Robot Repository**](https://github.com/TardyNoe/ECAM_Eurobot_2024_TeamErasmus/tree/main/Robot): Contains all the code, schematics, and documentation related to the robot's Arduino and ESP32 setup, sensors, and motor control.
- [**External Positioning System Repository**](https://github.com/TardyNoe/ECAM_Eurobot_2024_TeamErasmus/tree/main/Balise): Dedicated to the external positioning system, including its setup, code, and integration with the robot.

## Project Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** Utilizing ultrasonic sensors and motion tracking for precise movement.
- **Wireless Communication:** ESP32 module for Wi-Fi communication with the positioning system.
- **Advanced Control System:** Integrating Arduino Uno with motor controllers for efficient movement.
